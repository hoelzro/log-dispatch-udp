Log::Dispatch::UDP - Log messages to a remote UDP socket

=head1 VERSION

version 0.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Log::Dispatch;

  my log = Log::Dispatch->new(
    outputs => [
        [
            'UDP'
            host      => $destination_host,
            port      => $destination_port,
            min_level => 'info',
        ],
    ],
  );

  $log->info('my message');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This class can be used to write messages to a UDP socket
listening on some remote host.  The datagrams themselves
contain only the messages (there's no real structure to them),
so you can easily listen in using netcat.
